# Interview Pitch – Venue Ninja 🥷🎤

Use these bullets and snippets during technical interviews, recruiter calls, or live demos to communicate impact and thinking behind your project.

## 🎯 TL;DR Pitch (30 seconds)

"I built a Spring Boot REST API called *Venue Ninja* that returns curated seat recommendations for popular venues like Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium. It’s fully documented with Swagger, deployed to Render at [venue-ninja.onrender.com](https://venue-ninja.onrender.com), and showcases not just backend architecture but product-centric thinking. I designed it to demonstrate speed, structure, and creativity—all in under 48 hours."

## 🧠 Talking Points by Topic

### 💡 Why This Project?

* I drew from my experience at SeatGeek and imagined how I could model smart seat insights without needing live APIs.
* The name and branding help make it memorable and demo-ready.
* It demonstrates that even simple data can be organized with clarity and purpose.

### 🔧 Tech Stack

* Spring Boot with a REST controller-service-model structure
* Java 17 with Maven wrapper
* Swagger/OpenAPI auto-generated from annotations
* Mock data returned through hardcoded models (no DB needed)
* Containerized and deployed via Render (Docker)
* API live at: [https://venue-ninja.onrender.com](https://venue-ninja.onrender.com)
* Swagger UI: [https://venue-ninja.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html](https://venue-ninja.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html)

### 🏗️ System Architecture

* Clean separation of concerns: `Controller → Service → Model`
* Uses a `VenueService` to abstract data source from controller logic
* All data modeled explicitly for type safety and clarity
* Simple and extendable—new venues or endpoints are trivial to add

### 📘 Swagger Benefits

* Routes are documented directly from controller annotations
* Generates live documentation and testing interface
* Makes it interview/demo friendly—no Postman needed!

### 🚀 MVP Fast

* Designed and coded in <48 hours
* GitHub version-controlled
* Render deployed with Docker
* Docs, issues, pitch, and install all tracked under `/docs`

## 🗣️ If Asked:

### "Why Spring Boot?"

"I wanted to show I could ramp up fast in a framework that powers enterprise-scale apps. Spring Boot made it easy to scaffold and expose clean, testable endpoints."

### "Why no database?"

"Since this was an MVP built for demonstration, I kept it simple with mock data to prove out structure and flow. For production, I’d hook it up to Postgres or H2 with JPA."

### "What did you learn?"

* Rapid prototyping in Java after years away
* Using Spring’s annotation-based architecture confidently
* Swagger as both documentation *and* conversation starter
* Dockerizing a Java app and deploying to Render with a live link

### "How would you expand it?"

* Add persistent layer for user preferences or live data
* Admin dashboard to curate recommendations
* Integrate stadium APIs or scrape safe open datasets
* Build a frontend UI on Railway to consume API
* Add auth with API tokens or OAuth2

## 👑 Final Line (if you need one):

"Venue Ninja is small, but it reflects everything I bring to the table—technical skill, product empathy, speed, and a little fun."
