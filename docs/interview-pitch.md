# Interview Pitch – Venue Ninja 🥷🎤

Use these bullets and snippets during technical interviews, recruiter calls, or live demos to communicate impact and thinking behind your project.

## 🎯 TL;DR Pitch (30 seconds)

"I built a Spring Boot REST API called *Venue Ninja* that returns curated seat recommendations for popular venues like Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium. It’s fully documented with Swagger, deployable via Render, and showcases not just backend architecture but product-centric thinking. I designed it to demonstrate speed, structure, and creativity—all in under 72 hours."

## 🧠 Talking Points by Topic

### 💡 Why This Project?

* I drew from my experience at SeatGeek and imagined how I could model smart seat insights without needing live APIs.
* The name and branding help make it memorable and demo-ready.

### 🔧 Tech Stack

* Spring Boot with a REST controller-service-model structure
* Java 17 with Maven wrapper
* Swagger/OpenAPI for docs
* Mock data returned through hardcoded models (no DB needed)
* Deploys fast with Render; frontend-ready via Railway

### 🏗️ System Architecture

* Designed cleanly: `Controller → Service → Model`
* No database dependencies to simplify deploy and scale
* Easily extendable: you could add user profiles, real-time pricing, or a full seat map API

### 📘 Swagger Benefits

* Annotated each route and model for clarity
* Delivered a working spec for test/dev without extra YAML
* Let stakeholders (or interviewers) explore the app hands-on

### 🚀 MVP Fast

* Designed and coded in <72 hours
* Pushed to GitHub
* Deployed and documented
* Can be demoed with zero setup

## 🗣️ If Asked:

### "Why Spring Boot?"

"I wanted to show I could ramp up fast in a framework that powers enterprise-scale apps. Spring Boot made it easy to scaffold and expose clean, testable endpoints."

### "Why no database?"

"Since this was an MVP built for demonstration, I kept it simple with mock data to prove out structure and flow. If extended, I’d add JPA/H2 or PostgreSQL."

### "What did you learn?"

* Rapid prototyping in Java with confidence
* Swagger as both documentation *and* conversation starter
* How to scope a meaningful project around my background

### "How would you expand it?"

* Frontend UI for searching or favoriting seats
* Admin dashboard to curate recommendations
* Integrate stadium APIs or scrape safe open datasets
* Auth flow for saving user preferences

## 👑 Final Line (if you need one):

"Venue Ninja is small, but it reflects everything I bring to the table—technical skill, product empathy, speed, and a little fun."
